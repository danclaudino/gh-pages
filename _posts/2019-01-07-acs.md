<p>I'm happy to announce that my abstract was accepted for the next ACS National Meeting. I will be giving a talk entitled "Automatic Partition of Orbital Spaces Based on Singular Value Decomposition in the Context of Embedding Theories" in the Quantum Embedding Electronic Structure Methods. More details to come soon. </p>
