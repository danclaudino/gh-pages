<p> The preprint of the latest work is out on ChemRxiv! We propose a recursive SVD approach inspired by the SPADE partition aiming at the efficient truncation of the virtual spaces of embedded wave functions, which we call concentric localization. We have observe remarkable computational savings with negligible errors! You can check it out <a href="https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Simple_and_Efficient_Truncation_of_Virtual_Spaces_in_Embedded_Wave_Functions_via_Concentric_Localization/8846108/1">here</a>. </p>
