### Embedding theories

Embedding theories allow for massive savings in computational resources due to the alleviation of the steep scaling associated with many-body methods, since only a relatively small region of the molecular system receives high level theoretical treatment, all the while providing opportunity for tunable accuracy. We are currently investigating several aspects of projection-based embedding with the goal of making it more efficient and black-box.

### Efficient quantum chemistry algorithms on quantum computers

Traditional quantum chemistry is faced with the dilemma that no method is simulteanously variational and size-extensive. Unitary coupled cluster (UCC) can be both, but is comprised of an infinite number of terms when typical techniques are employed. Quantum computers have the prospect of solving the UCC equations, but current architectures face very short coherence times, which means limited number of gates. This constraint asks for efficient quantum algorithms that can operate well under such circumstances. Our focus is to take advantage of hybrids algorithms, such as variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), and survey variations of the usual UCC $ansatz$ that are better aligned to efficient quantum gates.

### Quantum Chemistry of Quantum Computers

A relatively new class of materials, known as single molecule magnets (SMM), have shown very good prospects in their application as qubits. A crucial step is determining whether a molecule is a SMM and whether it qualifies as candidate to be a qubit, which can be accomplished with aid of Quantum Chemistry. SMMs are often comprised of a heavy/rare-earth metal surrounded by one or more organic complexes. Due to its open-shell electronic configuration and relatively large nuclear mass, sizable relativistic and multiference effects are expected to play a critical role in the accurate treatment and characterization of these chemical systems.   

### Basis Set Development

This is an (somewhat) ongoing project with Prof. Rodney J. Bartlett following the main research developed during my Ph.D. Research in this area consists in new Gaussian basis sets constructed based on Coupled Cluster (CC) theory, more precisely on the Atomic Natural Orbitals (ANO) obtained from the (relaxed) one-particle reduced density matrix from some CC method (CCSD(T) so far). Preliminary studies showed the potential of this approach by applying this idea to the primitives found in the correlation consistent basis sets. Lately, we have been focusing on new primitive sets designed aiming at saturation of the corresponding angular momentum shells with respect to a given parameter, usually some energy quantity, in order to provide a more balanced treatment of atoms with distinct number of electrons. These new primitives are also subject to the ANO procedure, or its variant where the occupied molecular orbitals are "frozen", that is, restricted to be the lowest-energy HF vectors, hence called frozen ANO (FANO).
